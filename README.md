# Student Management Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) Implementation

## Environment

For this project, I wanted to make use of an open-source, non-proprietary service bus library to implement my own
bus. This project is derived from the `PublishSubsribe` sample outlined by the [`Shuttle.Esb` Framework](https://github.com/Shuttle/Shuttle.Esb.Samples/tree/master/Shuttle.PublishSubscribe). For
more in-depth information on the mechanics of that framework (outside the confines of the below documentation), please consult the above-linked project.
